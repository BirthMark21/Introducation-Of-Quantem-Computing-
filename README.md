# Introducation-Of-Quantem-Computing-
This repository contains implementations of fundamental quantum circuits using Qiskit, including quantum superposition, entanglement, and probabilistic quantum behavior. Each program demonstrates key quantum computing concepts with circuit visualization and measurement analysis.


1️⃣Create a Quantum Circuit with a Hadamard Gate
Write a Qiskit program to create a single-qubit circuit.
Apply a Hadamard gate to the qubit.
Measure the qubit and visualize the result using a histogram.

2️⃣ Implement a Quantum Coin Flip
Simulate a fair coin flip using a quantum circuit.
Print the probability of getting Heads or Tails.

3️ Implement a Bell State (Entanglement)
Create a two-qubit circuit.
Apply a Hadamard gate to the first qubit and a CNOT gate between the two qubits.
Measure both qubits and verify if they are always correlated.


4️⃣ Generate Plus state
Constructs a quantum circuit to prepare the |+⟩ (pulse) state from the |0⟩ state.
Applies the Hadamard gate, which creates an equal superposition of |0⟩ and |1⟩.
Measures the qubit and verifies the probability distribution.
